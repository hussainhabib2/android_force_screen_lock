## Android Force Screen Lock
I created this nifty little native Java app that does one thing â€“ force locks your screen the moment you open it. No fuss, no muss. Just a quick fix for when your power button decides to ghost on you.

## How It Works
This app gets the job done using the Device Admin APIs. The first time you open it, it'll ask for permission to allow the app to use device admin lock screen API. Give it the green light, and you're good to go!
