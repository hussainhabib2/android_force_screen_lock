## Android Force Screen Lock
I created this nifty little native Java app that does one thing â€“ locks your screen the moment you open it. No fuss, no muss. Just a quick fix for when your power button decides to ghost on you.

## Why I Made This
My power button called it quits, and I needed a way to lock my screen without the drama. Plus, who needs ads cluttering up a simple task? So, here we are!

## How It Works
This app gets the job done using the Device Admin APIs. First time you open it, it'll ask for permission to lock things up. Give it the green light, and you're good to go!
